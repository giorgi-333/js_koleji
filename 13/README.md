# Project Title

This project is a simple JavaScript application designed to demonstrate basic functionality and serve as a starting point for further development.

```javascript
// Your JavaScript code goes here
console.log("Hello, World!");
```
const fruits = ["Banana", "Orange", "Apple", "Mango"];
fruits.sort();
fruits.reverse();

This is how JavaScript's internal sorting engine works:

  fruits.sort((a, b) => a.localeCompare(b, 'ka')); // 'ka' = Georgian locale
